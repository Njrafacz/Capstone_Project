My capstone was originally going to be a chess program. 
However, due to the complexity of the task, I decided to change to tic-tac-toe.
Currently, my program can play single player tic tac toe. In the future, I would like to add player vs AI.
Tic Tac Toe sythesizes many concepts including MouseListener, GUI, 2D arrays and boolean logic.

To run my capstone, simply run the main method of the program.
