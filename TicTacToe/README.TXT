My capstone was originally going to be a chess program. 
However, due to the complexity of the task, I decided to change to tic-tac-toe.
Currently, my program can play single player tic tac toe. In the future, I would like to add player vs AI.
Tic Tac Toe sythesizes many concepts including MouseListener, GUI, 2D arrays and boolean logic.
This Capstone forced me to learn alot more about how to build GUIs. I had to extend on the previous experience I had
and was required to delve into new conceptss.

To run my capstone, simply run the main method of the program.
